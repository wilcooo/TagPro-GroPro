## Features

### version 1.0: The basics
- [x] Chat notifications when on another tab/window
- [x] A ready system, click a button to put 'ready' beneath your name
- [x] Name color (red/blue), timestamps, color new & unread messages
- [x] Chat beeps and boops and bwleps (sounds)
- [x] Send messages longer than 120 characters (For people without the script it'll look like multiple messages)
- [x] Arrow up/down lets you send a message that you've sent before (like in a console/terminal)
- [x] Group description, can be set by the admin(s) and is shown to everyone (and also sent to those without the script)
- [x] Don't scroll down for new messages when you are reading old messages (instead show an arrow)

### *[upcoming]* version 2.0: The Admin update
- [ ] Direct link to a connected Mumble Group (optionally for both teams)
- [ ] Option for multiple people to edit settings (leader can appoint 'admins')
- [ ] Player whitelist/blacklist
- [ ] Setting presets (just like the 'competitive-settings', but more variaty)
- [ ] Save the chat log, so that after a refresh or game the old messages are still there
- [ ] Highlight leader in chat

### Random ideas for future updates
- [ ] Integration with [rankedPUGs](http://www.lejdesigns.com/rankedPUGs/index.php)
- [ ] Edit previously sent messages (For people without the script it'll look like a new message)
- [ ] Group icon (that also shows up on notifications). Can for example be set to a leagues' logo
- [ ] LastSeen time next to players (after 30 seconds, they auto-disconnect)
- [ ] Auto-reply: whenever someone mentions you, a pre-set message is sent.
- [ ] Voting for maps (Everyone has a vote), maybe other settings/teams/whatever too
- [ ] Auto-kick AFK players (maybe only when the group is full, to make room for others)
- [ ] Map playlist (automatically proceed playing when the game ends, very lazy I know)
- [ ] Private games with less than 4 players
- [ ] Don't miss messages that are sent during joining/leaving a game or going to another page
- [ ] Show group selection (when not joined) and maybe group chat (when joined) on the homepage
- [ ] I don't know, suggest me things and I'll probably add them sometime

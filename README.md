- [x] Chat beeps and boops and bwleps

- [ ] LastSeen time next to players (after 30 seconds, they auto-disconnect)
- [ ] Welcome message for people without the script
- [ ] Link to a connected Mumble Group (for both teams)
- [ ] Voting for maps
- [ ] Option for multiple admins (admin can appoint 'sub-admins')
- [ ] Auto-kick AFK players
- [ ] Map playlist (automatically proceed playing when the game ends, very lazy I know)
- [ ] Making use of the 'spec glitch'?? If it exists
- [ ] Player whitelist/blacklist
- [ ] Private games with less than 4 players
- [ ] Setting presets (just like the 'competitive-settings', but more variaty)
- [ ] DON'T MISS MESSAGES THAT ARE SENT DURING JOINING/LEAVING A GAME OR GOING TO ANOTHER PAGE
- [ ] Save the chat log, so that after a refresh or game the old messages are still there

## Plans for features

### Cool!
- [x] Chat notifications when on another tab/window
- [x] Name color (red/blue), timestamps, color new & unread messages
- [x] Chat beeps and boops and bwleps
- [x] Send messages longer than 120 characters (For people without the script it'll look like multiple messages)
- [x] Arrow up/down lets you send a message that you've sent before
- [x] Group description, can be set by the admin(s) and is shown to everyone (and also sent to those without the script)
- [ ] Don't scroll down for new messages when you are reading old messages (instead show an arrow)
- [ ] Link to a connected Mumble Group (for both teams)
- [ ] Option for multiple admins (admin can appoint 'sub-admins')
- [ ] Player whitelist/blacklist
- [ ] Setting presets (just like the 'competitive-settings', but more variaty)
- [ ] Save the chat log, so that after a refresh or game the old messages are still there
- [ ] Highlight leader in chat

### Maybe
- [ ] Edit previously sent messages (For people without the script it'll look like a new message)
- [ ] LastSeen time next to players (after 30 seconds, they auto-disconnect)
- [ ] Auto-reply: whenever someone mentions you, that message is sent.
- [ ] Voting for maps
- [ ] Auto-kick AFK players
- [ ] Map playlist (automatically proceed playing when the game ends, very lazy I know)
- [ ] Making use of the 'spec glitch'?? If it exists
- [ ] Private games with less than 4 players
- [ ] DON'T MISS MESSAGES THAT ARE SENT DURING JOINING/LEAVING A GAME OR GOING TO ANOTHER PAGE
